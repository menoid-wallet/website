# 🌑 Menoid Wallet
An AI-native private crypto wallet.

## ✨ Introduction
Menoid is an AI-native private smart wallet built for multi-chain privacy, supporting 15+ chains. 

Unlike traditional wallets that publicly expose every interaction and require users to manually understand complex onchain actions, Menoid combines privacy infrastructure, smart accounts, and AI-assisted execution into a seamless wallet experience.

Menoid enables users to:

🌍 Use both Public Mode and Noid Mode depending on how visible they want to be onchain
🕶️ Transfer assets privately through Noid Mode
🔐 Interact with onchain protocols privately through Noid Smart Accounts
🤖 Get an integrated AI companion called Meno across the entire wallet experience
⚡ Let Meno simulate transactions before execution and explain what could happen
🚨 Receive warnings from Meno about suspicious or dangerous onchain activities
🔎 Explore and discover protocols, NFT collections, DeFi platforms, and new onchain opportunities through Meno
🚀 Receive live market-style suggestions from Meno — for example, notifying users when a token suddenly surges in activity, volume, or price movement and suggesting possible actions like buy, sell, or swap
⏰ Schedule secure transfers, swaps, purchases, and automated actions — even in Noid Mode
📰 Stay updated with crypto and ecosystem news through Menews
💬 Chat with Meno about crypto, protocols, wallet activity, and the Menoid ecosystem
🛡️ Maintain privacy while remaining fully composable with multi-chain protocols

## 🌌 Vision
Menoid expands beyond private transfers into a complete AI-native private smart wallet ecosystem for 15+ chains.

The goal is not only to hide balances — but to give users full control over how they exist and interact onchain, with an integrated AI companion that helps users navigate crypto, understand risks, discover opportunities, and interact smarter across the entire wallet experience.

Users should be able to:
- 🌍 Switch seamlessly between Public Mode and Noid Mode
- 👻 Become ghosts onchain when privacy is needed
- 🔐 Interact with protocols privately through Noid infrastructure
- 🧠 Execute interactions through zk-authorized smart accounts
- 🤖 Use an integrated AI companion called Meno across the wallet experience
- ⚡ Understand transactions, risks, and protocol behavior before execution
- 🔎 Discover new protocols, NFTs, tokens, and ecosystem opportunities through Meno
- 📰 Stay updated with crypto ecosystem activity through Menews
- 🔐 Hold assets privately while remaining fully composable with multi-chain protocols

## 🌐 Private Execution Layer
Menoid introduces a private execution architecture where users interact with protocols through private smart execution accounts called Noid Smart Accounts (Unlinkable pseudonymous execution).

Instead of directly exposing wallet activity publicly, Menoid abstracts:
- 👤 User identity
- 🔗 Protocol interaction relationships
- 📜 Smart contract execution ownership
- 🌊 DeFi activity correlations
through zk-based execution authorization.

The goal is to make:
- 🔄 Private swaps
- 🌊 Stealth liquidity positions
- 🏦 Invisible lending strategies
- 📜 Private smart contract interactions
- 🕶️ Hidden on-chain activity
feel native across 15+ chains.

## 🖥️ Wallet Ecosystem
Menoid is being designed as a complete AI-native smart wallet infrastructure.

The ecosystem direction includes:
- 🌑 Browser wallet extension
- ⚡ Sidebar-first wallet architecture
- 🤖 Integrated AI companion called Meno across the wallet experience
- 📚 Developer SDKs & integration libraries
- 🔗 Wallet-provider injection system
- 🧩 Smart account infrastructure
- 📡 Relayer-powered private execution
- 🛡️ zk-authorized transaction flows
- 📰 Menews — integrated crypto ecosystem updates by Meno
- ⏰ Secure scheduled transfers, swaps, purchases, and automated actions
- 🔎 AI-powered protocol, NFT, and token discovery infrastructure

The goal is to provide a wallet experience where privacy and AI become integrated primitives — not additional tools.

## ⚡ Direction
Menoid aims to evolve into an AI-native private execution layer for 15+ chains.

A smart wallet where users can:
- 🌍 Interact publicly when desired
- 👻 Disappear privately through Noid Mode when needed
- 🤖 Navigate crypto with an integrated AI companion called Meno
- ⚡ Understand transactions and protocol interactions before execution
- 🔎 Discover opportunities, tokens, NFTs, and ecosystem activity in real time
while maintaining:
- ⚡ Fast UX
- 🌐 Full protocol composability
- 🔐 Strong privacy guarantees
- 🧩 Seamless smart wallet interactions
- 🛡️ Intelligent onchain safety and guidance
